                This text proposes that freewriting is the most effective way to improve one’s writing because 
                it allows for the unhindered expression of one’s natural voice. One of writing’s main advantages 
                is that it allows more room for editing and revision, but if overdone and combined with a sense of
                 perfectionism, it could be a major impediment and source of writer’s block. Elbow says that “in 
                 [one’s] natural way of producing words there is a sound, a texture, a rhythm - a voice - which is 
                 the main source of power in [one’s] writing,” and the process of editing places distance between 
                 the writer and that voice. Freewriting helps bring that voice to the surface instead of burying it
                  beneath a need for perfection.

                Elbow’s article especially resonates with me because the only way I can get things going when I 
                have a particularly bad case of writer’s block is by freewriting. I feel like he was @ing me when
                 he said that “trying to get the beginning just right is a formula for failure.” I am already 
                 actively applying the author’s suggestions to my own life and my own writing and will continue 
                 to do so in the future. I can also apply the key point of this text to other aspects of my life
                  outside of writing - I don’t need to be perfect at everything; I just need to start.
