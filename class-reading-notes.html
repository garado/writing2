                This text proposes that freewriting is the most effective way to improve one’s writing because 
                it allows for the unhindered expression of one’s natural voice. One of writing’s main advantages 
                is that it allows more room for editing and revision, but if overdone and combined with a sense of
                 perfectionism, it could be a major impediment and source of writer’s block. Elbow says that “in 
                 [one’s] natural way of producing words there is a sound, a texture, a rhythm - a voice - which is 
                 the main source of power in [one’s] writing,” and the process of editing places distance between 
                 the writer and that voice. Freewriting helps bring that voice to the surface instead of burying it
                  beneath a need for perfection.

            <div class="notes-content">
                Elbow’s article especially resonates with me because the only way I can get things going when I 
                have a particularly bad case of writer’s block is by freewriting. I feel like he was @ing me when
                 he said that “trying to get the beginning just right is a formula for failure.” I am already 
                 actively applying the author’s suggestions to my own life and my own writing and will continue 
                 to do so in the future. I can also apply the key point of this text to other aspects of my life
                  outside of writing - I don’t need to be perfect at everything; I just need to start.

                In this article, Graff and Birkenstein emphasize the importance of clearly 
                stating one's point in addition to the reason why the point needs to be made. 
                A good way to do this is to give the argument context: you should introduce what 
                others are saying and only afterwards introduce your own ideas as a 
                response. You can also summarize your ideas first briefly and then delay 
                explanation for later.

                Writing Speaks to Situations Through Recognizable Forms

            <div class="notes-content">
                In this article, Bazerman states that how we communicate is dependent on 
                the situation we're in and what kind of message we want to communicate. 
                This process is harder to do in writing - there are "fewer here-and-now 
                clues about audience [and] situation... so we need to understand the 
                rhetorical situation." Understanding the rhetorical situation involves 
                knowing genre, associated situations, and activity systems.

                In this article, Roozen states that our interpretation of a text is heavily

                talks, visuals, etc.). He states that "forging and reconfiguring linkages to 
                other texts and even other contexts can shift meaning in ways both subtle 
                and profound."

                Failure Can Be An Important Part of Writing Development

                In this text, Brooke and Carr stress the importance of failure in 
                the writing process. They emphasize the role of mistakes in fostering 
                intellectual growth in students. Instead of culminating in a 
                high-stakes final writing assessment that ultimately discourages students from 
                trying new things in an attempt to avoid failure, classrooms should focus 
                more on providing apt conditions for their students to grow as writers. They 
                close off the text by highlighting how important the capacity for failure is and 
                how important it is to see failure as an opportunity for growth.

            <div class="notes-content">
                This one really resonated with me. I have an extremely weird relationship with 
                failure - or maybe it's normal and I'm just not seeing other people hide it. 
                I don't like pushing myself out of my comfort zone and utterly failing. It's 
                gotten better as time has gone on, but it's still rough. Anyways, insecurities 
                and deeply ingrained fears aside, I can use what I've learned from this text to 
                improve my writing by asking for feedback on my writing whenever I can. I can also 
                continually revise and edit my shitty first drafts until they're halfway decent and 
                no longer shitty.

                This text is basically saying that nobody knows what the hell they're doing with punctuation. Casagrande points out five million 
                different places in a sentence in which editors and professionals could potentially disagree about how to punctuate a sentence. 
                It turns out that there's more than one way to punctuate a sentence - which to choose depends on the 
                meaning that you want to create in your sentence.

            <div class="notes-content">
                I'm glad there's 894712397134 different ways to punctuate because prior to coming to college, I would always get really heated when 
                my classmates would correct my papers and they would mark my punctuation as wrong when I knew damn well it wasn't. It turns out we were 
                both right and that comma definitely <i>could</i> exist there, Vince from 6th grade. Wow, I didn't expect this class to give me so much 
                validation. Anyways, I can use this newfound knowledge in my writing from hereon out by being especially careful in scenarios where I'm 
                unsure of how to punctuate my sentences. By doing this, I can be sure that I'm putting my commas or whatever in a place that helps me 
                best convey my meaning.

                This text briefly goes over the different types of punctuation, their uses, and how they can affect the pace of writing, as well as how everybody and their 
                mommas disagree on how to use them and how different authors develop their own punctuation styles.

            <div class="notes-content">
                I definitely recognize the effect punctuation has on pacing - for one of my additional writing study entries, I wrote a single run-on sentence that 
                was the length of an entire paragraph on purpose and rereading it felt like I was running a marathon. <i>That</i> definitely could have used some more 
                punctuation. In my writing, I can incorporate what I've learned by making sure that my punctuation matches the pacing that I want in my writing.
