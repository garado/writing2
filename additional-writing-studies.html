                This article deals with how to make words that end in S possessive,
                as in Kansas’s vs. Kansas’. According to Grammar Girl, either way is
                perfectly acceptable and which to choose is simply a matter of style.
                AP style does not add an extra S after the apostrophe, whereas the
                Chicago style does (with a few very rare exceptions). I wholeheartedly
                appreciate this article because I have, despite major opposition from
                everyone and their moms and lots of red-pen corrections from past English
                teachers, long stood by my choice to add an extra S after the apostrophe. 
                This is a hill I will die on.
                Thank you, Grammar Girl, for reconfirming the validity I always knew my
                stylistic choices had.

                In 1886, lexicographer Walter Skeat defined ghost words as words that had "no real existence."
                In other words, they're words that were accidentally made up through misreadings, transcription errors, 
                or typos.
                One example is the word "syllabus," which comes from ancient Greece and was originally spelled "sittybas"
                or "sittubas." Somewhere along the way, someone miscopied it as "syllabus" and that's where we get
                the word today. I think the entire idea of ghost words being accidentally made up is so funny
                because all words (and all languages, for that matter) are made up anyways. 
                I also think my boy Walter's definition of a ghost word is funny
                too because he's saying the words aren't real, and yet... there they are, in all their definitely existent glory,
                existing in whatever language the word exists in just to spite him.

                This article interested me because I've probably swiped through half
                of Santa Cruz. It defines four fancy new dating terms - as the title of the article would suggest, they're 
                swipe right/left, ghosting, Tinderella, and phubbing. I learned that the phrase "swipe right/left" 
                can also be used to show that you like or dislike random inanimate objects <i>outside</i> of Tinder, which is 
                a context in which I've never seen it used before. I also learned about the phrase Tinderella, which is defined as a 
                girl who spends a whole lot of time on Tinder. (They might as well have linked my profile in the definition.)
                Last but not least, there's <s>the reason I broke up with my ex</s> phubbing! Really glad this one has an 
                actual definition, because it comes up in my life unnecessarily often because people don't know how to date or 
                communicate face-to-face. (Or maybe I just have bad taste.) (Or all of the above?)

                Why Does ‘Love’ Mean ‘Zero’ in Tennis?

                I've always wanted an answer to this question! I played tennis throughout high school and always wondered why it was called that. 
                I certainly didn't love anything about having scored zero points. (Which was unfortunately very often - I wasn't good at tennis.) 
                It turns out that nobody's 100% sure where the term comes from. One prominent theory is that the French word for egg is <i>l'oeuf</i>, and an egg looks like a 
                zero, so someone decided to connect the two, and then another English-speaking someone decided that l'oeuf sounded like love, and the 
                rest is history.

                I had to pick this article because I love Chipotle. Their burrito bowls? Shmack. Everything off their menu <b><i><u>HITS</u></i></b>. 
                The restaurant's name comes from a Nahuatl word meaning "smoked chili pepper,"" which is exactly what the non-restaurant chipotle pepper is
                 - a regular jalapeno that's been dried and smoked. I read a cursed Tumblr post calling for Chipotle to be pronounced like Aristotle and I
                 fully support that movement.

                What Are Run-On Sentences?

                A run-on sentence is a sentence that takes one or more complete sentences and meshes them together without any punctuation separating them which is 
                exactly what I'm about to do for this paragraph I'm fairly picky about grammar so this is painful for me to write anyways this article 
                discusses various different ways to remedy a run-on sentence none of which I'm going to use but one of them is actually using punctuation 
                like commas, semicolons, and periods to separate sentences instead of wholly ignoring their existence and the article also touches on 
                how the tone and message you're trying to convey in a sentence may alter the way that you remediate your poor hundred-mile-long sentence you know
                I think I do a good job avoiding the use of run-on sentences in my own formal writing but when I'm texting a friend I seem to use nothing
                but run-on sentences and I've noticed that my friends do as well and instead of using actual punctuation to separate our sentences we use 
                abbreviations or exclamations like LMFAO or lmaoooo or haha or LOL and that's really interesting to me LOL I would like to see an in-depth study 
                on the development of "gen Z linguistics" or "the gen Z dialect" because it's so prominent, it's literally everywhere, and I want to learn about 
                how it came into existence because I think most people my age know what a run-on sentence is and how to not write one but we all write them 
                everyday I think it's funny how we all know exactly what the rules are but break them every day for the sake of conforming to a popular dialect or
                whatever the reason behind it is haha it's the same thing with the word "literally" - I hate it when people (and it's usually old white men) try to
                lecture me on what the word "literally" means because BROTHER OF COURSE I know what literally means, I've taken an English class before, it's just how
                my generation talks and the irony of using the word "literally" non-literally creates MEANING Jesus Christ Harold please leave teenage girls
                alone and go back to your cubicle at your 9-5.

                Also, I took a break halfway through to read about millenial/gen Z linguistics and ended up reading a <a class="in-text" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-eolrBhv5RFLU5zQVJPOWNjLUE/edit" target="_blank">70-page dissertation</a> about it.

                The History and Glory of the Spelling Bee
            </div>
            <div class="studies-author">
                Grammar Girl

            <div class="studies-content">
                Let me preface this paragraph by saying that the fact that the English language even has a spelling bee is insane. I was in the Scripps 
                National Spelling Bee when I was in middle school and I distinctly remember getting the ten-page packet of words to study and thinking,
                "Fuuuuuck that." There were random, extremely long, consonant-heavy German words in there and random other words from other languages that 
                I didn't even know were languages and random words in English that definitely looked more like erratic keysmashes than words. It was when I 
                was staring down the word "zeitgeist" for the hundredth time that my twelve-year-old self realized that English is for psychopaths. We have a 
                language that's essentially the bastard child of five million other languages with words so horrendously difficult to spell that we pit hundreds 
                of elementary and middle school children against each other in an annual fight to the death for linguistic clout. Crazy.
                <br>
                Complete bewilderment at the English language aside, I'm not sure how to feel about spelling bees. The article poses some good points - in the process of 
                studying, participants learn about etymology, the history of the English language as a whole, and the value of hard work and determination. However, the 
                whole ordeal definitely sounds like a playground for a batshit insane helicopter tiger mom to force their poor child into. It sounds like just another 
                thing to put on a college application (and I <i>hate</i> when people do things just to put it on a college application). Spelling bees seem like something 
                that people do for clout rather than for the love of the English language, and I definitely did it for clout back then. Can we all thank God that I've grown 
                out of my clout-chasing phase? (And can I get $10 for every time I've used the word "clout" in this paragraph?)<br>
                The word that got me out, by the way, was adolescents - I spelled adolescence instead.

                The other week, my linear algebra professor asked the class if anybody knew what "i.e." meant. I wish I'd read this article back then so I could've
                flexed my Latin on 300 people.<br>
                I've always wondered what the difference between i.e. and E.g. were, and this article has so graciously enlightened me. I.e. is an abbreviation 
                for the Latin phrase "id est" and roughly means "that is." E.g. is an abbreviation for "exempli gratia" and means "for example."
