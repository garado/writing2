                This article deals with how to make words that end in S possessive,
                as in Kansas’s vs. Kansas’. According to Grammar Girl, either way is
                perfectly acceptable and which to choose is simply a matter of style.
                AP style does not add an extra S after the apostrophe, whereas the
                Chicago style does (with a few very rare exceptions). I wholeheartedly
                appreciate this article because I have, despite major opposition from
                everyone and their moms and lots of red-pen corrections from past English
                teachers, long stood by my choice to add an extra S after the apostrophe.
                Thank you, Grammar Girl, for reconfirming the validity I always knew my
                stylistic choices had.
