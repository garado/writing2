            This project taught me a lot about my own writing. I realized that I only like writing when my natural voice and style aren't suppressed - part of 
            why I hated high school writing classes so much is because I had to write in the cookie-cutter style that the AP exam graders would like. I appreciated 
            this project and this class because I didn't have to do that at all. (Well, except for the Fancy Formal Academic Research Papers, but even then, that was 
            about a topic I really liked, so I didn't mind.) It re-sparked that love of writing that I used to have when I was younger.

            By doing this project, I also discovered the real reason behind my crippling writer's block. It's caused by a fear of failure and intense perfectionism. 
            (Shoutout to Anne Lamott for helping me realize that.) The Shitty First Drafts article really opened my eyes and taught me that literally everyone fucking
            sucks when they start writing and that there isn't a single great writer alive that writes like Shakespeare on their first try. I learned that it's okay to 
            suck! In the words of Jake the Dog from Adventure Time, "sucking at something is the first step to being sort of good at something." This is a lesson that 
            I can carry with me and apply to the rest of my life as well.

            Overall, this writing development journal helped me achieve the main goal that I set for myself at the beginning of the quarter, which was to rediscover 
            how much I liked writing. I also greatly improved my annoying lil writer's block weakness. Another unexpected thing that I learned was that I get extremely motivated 
            to do stuff when I tie things into my personal hobbies/interests. I put off this WDJ for a while until I got the idea to make a really aesthetic website for it.
            I spent a couple hours coding the website from scratch, which finally got me to stop procrastinating on it. I'm definitely still missing some entries here and there, but at 
            least it's pretty.

            <b>One.</b> My writing process was kind of shitty before I took Writing 2. In the past, I would spend hours trying to deal with writer's block and I 
            would have immense difficulty just getting something onto the paper. I would end up just staring at a blank Google document and have only a few 
            sentences written after a couple of hours. This class has helped me get over a lot of that! Reading Lamott's "Shitty First Drafts" article helped 
            me recognize my inability to start writing for what it secretly was - a fear of failure. Now, when I start papers, I literally just write whatever 
            bullshit springs into mind. I did exactly that for my Project D first draft and I managed to write three pages in an hour - they were shitty pages,
            but they were pages!
        </div>

        <div class="notes-content">
            <b>Two.</b> My greatest strengths as a writer are my knowledge of correct grammar/writing conventions. I'm good at identifying when things don't 
            sound right and I can string sentences together so that they flow together nicely. I'm alright at pacing my writing as well. Another thing I like 
            about my writing is my voice and style - I think part of why I hated writing so much in high school was because I had to suppress it to appeal to 
            those dusty old AP graders and my annoyingly prim-and-proper literature teachers. I feel a lot more free and more able to be my own person in this 
            class, which I really appreciate. I can continue growing these strengths by continuing to write! I want to make time to get back into writing 
            short stories like I used to when I was younger.

        <div class="notes-content">
            <b>Three.</b> I still feel like I'm weak at writing concisely. A lot of my writing tends to have a lot of redundant/fluff content and filler words; a lot of 
            my sentences could be written much more cleanly and succinctly. To improve, I can keep this in mind during the editing process and make 
            sure that I edit and revise for clarity and conciseness.
        </div>

        <div class="notes-content">
            <b>Four.</b> I'm a lot less perfectionistic with my writing now. I've really embraced the idea of literally getting whatever bullshit down on 
                paper first just to have something - you can edit something shitty, but you can't edit something that doesn't exist. I don't think that 
                my first draft needs to be 100% perfect anymore and I enjoy the process of writing a lot more than I did at the beginning of the quarter.

            <b>Five.</b> Yikes! I'm not done with Project B, C, or D.

            <b>Six.</b> Hope you like the layout of my WDJ! I had a lot of fun making it. I coded the entire site from scratch. And thanks for the great 
            quarter - I didn't expect to have a lot of fun in this class, but I ended up liking it more than I like my major classes. For an extremely brief 
            moment, I considered switching from my major (computer engineering) to writing or English language.
