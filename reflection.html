            <b>One.</b> My writing process was kind of shitty before I took Writing 2. In the past, I would spend hours trying to deal with writer's block and I 
            would have immense difficulty just getting something onto the paper. I would end up just staring at a blank Google document and have only a few 
            sentences written after a couple of hours. This class has helped me get over a lot of that! Reading Lamott's "Shitty First Drafts" article helped 
            me recognize my inability to start writing for what it secretly was - a fear of failure. Now, when I start papers, I literally just write whatever 
            bullshit springs into mind. I did exactly that for my Project D first draft and I managed to write three pages in an hour - they were shitty pages,
            but they were pages!

            <b>Two.</b> My greatest strengths as a writer are my knowledge of correct grammar/writing conventions.

            <b>Three.</b> My relationship with writing improved, which was one of my goals at the beginning of the quarter.
