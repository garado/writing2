            <b>One.</b> My writing process was kind of shitty before I took Writing 2. In the past, I would spend hours trying to deal with writer's block and I 
            would have immense difficulty just getting something onto the paper. I would end up just staring at a blank Google document and have only a few 
            sentences written after a couple of hours. This class has helped me get over a lot of that! Reading Lamott's "Shitty First Drafts" article helped 
            me recognize my inability to start writing for what it secretly was - a fear of failure. Now, when I start papers, I literally just write whatever 
            bullshit springs into mind. I did exactly that for my Project D first draft and I managed to write three pages in an hour - they were shitty pages,
            but they were pages!

            <b>Two.</b> My greatest strengths as a writer are my knowledge of correct grammar/writing conventions. I'm good at identifying when things don't 
            sound right and I can string sentences together so that they flow together nicely. I'm alright at pacing my writing as well. Another thing I like 
            about my writing is my voice and style - I think part of why I hated writing so much in high school was because I had to suppress it to appeal to 
            those dusty old AP graders and my annoyingly prim-and-proper literature teachers. I feel a lot more free and more able to be my own person in this 
            class, which I really appreciate. I can continue growing these strengths by continuing to write! I want to make time to get back into writing 
            short stories like I used to when I was younger.

        <div class="notes-content">
            <b>Three.</b> I still feel like I'm weak at writing concisely. A lot of my writing tends to have a lot of redundant/fluff content and filler words; a lot of 
            my sentences could be written much more cleanly and succinctly. To improve, I can keep this in mind during the editing process and make 
            sure that I edit and revise for clarity and conciseness.
        </div>

        <div class="notes-content">
            <b>Four.</b> I'm a lot less perfectionistic with my writing now. I've really embraced the idea of literally getting whatever bullshit down on 
                paper first just to have something - you can edit something shitty, but you can't edit something that doesn't exist. I don't think that 
                my first draft needs to be 100% perfect anymore and I enjoy the process of writing a lot more than I did at the beginning of the quarter.

            <b>Five.</b> Yikes! I'm not done with Project B, C, or D.

            <b>Six.</b> Hope you like the layout of my WDJ! I had a lot of fun making it. I coded the entire site from scratch. And thanks for the great 
            quarter - I didn't expect to have a lot of fun in this class, but I ended up liking it more than I like my major classes. For an extremely brief 
            moment, I considered switching from my major (computer engineering) to writing or English language.
