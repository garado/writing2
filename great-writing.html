                If a person can't get out of bed, something is making them exhausted. If a student isn't writing papers, there's some aspect
                of the assignment that they can't do without help. If an employee misses deadlines constantly, something is making organization
                and deadline-meeting difficult. Even if a person is actively choosing to self-sabotage, there's a reason for it - some fear
                they're working through, some need not being met, a lack of self-esteem being expressed. People do not choose to fail or
                disappoint. No one wants to feel incapable, apathetic, or ineffective. If you look at a person's actions (or inaction)
                and see only laziness, you are missing key details. There is always an explanation. There are always barriers. Just because
                you can't see them, or don't view them as legitimate, doesn't mean they're not there. Look harder. Maybe you weren't always
                able to look at human behavior this way. That's okay. Now you are. Give it a try.

                I went downstairs to Dad's encyclopedia and looked up HOMOSEXUALITY, but that didn't tell me much about any of the things
                I felt. What struck me most, though, was that, in that whole long article, the word "love" wasn't used even once. That made
                me mad; it was as if whoever wrote the article didn't know that gay people actually love each other. The encyclopedia writers
                ought to talk to me, I thought as I went back to bed; I would tell them something about love.

                People will say they aren't attractive and then go create art and then go write beautiful poetry and then
