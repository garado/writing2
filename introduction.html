            Iâ€™ve had a really weird relationship with writing throughout my life. When I was younger, I
            used to <i>love</i> writing and would be constantly writing random short stories and poems. 
            I started despising writing later on down the line because of nightmares with classes like my
            AP Lit class, where the teacher tried to morph us all into cookie-cutter poetry analyzers. One of my main goals for this 
            quarter in this class is to improve (and hopefully even restore)
            my past relationship with writing. I want to not despise every minute of the process and actually have fun with it
            like I used to, and hopefully I can find a way to do that through this journal. The WDJ project is entirely self-directed, so I get to 
            write about what I want in whatever style I want - I haven't submitted a piece of unfiltered and unrestrained writing in years. Hopefully the 
            fact that I finally get some freedom makes the process easier.

            Shitty experiences in high school writing classes aside, I've always appreciated the English language and am excited to learn how 
            to command it better in order to produce better writing. I'm also interested in potentially putting a name to all of the unspoken rules of the English 
            language that I as a native English speaker have subtly picked up on, such as that one weird thing about having all adjectives specifically in 
            the order of opinion-size-age-shape-colour-origin-material-purpose-noun. Yay English!
