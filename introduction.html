            Iâ€™ve had a really weird relationship with writing throughout my life. When I was younger, I
             used to <i>love</i> writing and would be constantly writing random short stories about things.
              I started despising writing later on down the line because of nightmares with classes like my
               AP Lit class. One of my main goals for this class is to improve (and hopefully even restore)
                my past relationship with writing. I want to not despise every minute of the process.
